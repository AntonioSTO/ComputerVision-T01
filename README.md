# ComputerVision-T01
A Rigid Body motion and Perspective Projection algorithm with a visual interface

## What can be done with this code?
    - Visualize tridimensional position and orientation of a camera and an object
    - Change the camera's position and orientation (extrinsic parameters) by tridimensional translations and rotations
    - Visualize the object image generated by the camera
    - Change intrinsic parameters such as focal distance, scale factor of each axis, and others.

## Why was this code made?
This is the result of a project demanded by our computer vision class. 

## How can I run this code?
Just run "interface.py", it's really simple!
